(** This module provides rewriting operations on MFOTL formulas.

    We follow here the procedure described in Samuel Mueller's PhD
    thesis "Theory and Applications of Runtime Monitoring Metric
    First-order Temporal Logic", Section 5.3 "Syntactical
    Approximation \[of the class of TSF domain independent formulas\]
    based on Rewriting".

val no_rw: bool ref
val unfold_let: expand_mode option ref
  (** Flags corresponding to the command-line options -no_rw and -unfold_let. *)

val normalize: formula -> formula
  (** This function normalizes a formula by eliminating synactic
      sugar, pushing down negations, and eliminating double
      negation. *)

val is_special_case: (var list) -> formula -> bool
(** Returns [true] if the formula does not need to be evaluated
    independently. *)

val is_monitorable: formula -> bool * (formula * string) option

val check_formula: schema -> formula -> formula * (var * tcst) list
(** Checks well-formedness and syntax of the given formula.
    Returns [pf, vtypes], where [pf] is a formula equivalent with input
    formula and [vtypes] is the list of free variables of [pf]
    together with their types *)
